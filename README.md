# Spam Email Classifier

This project is a simple **Spam Email Classifier** implemented in Python. It uses machine learning to classify text messages as spam or not spam. This project was developed to demonstrate a basic understanding of text classification using Naive Bayes in an academic context.

## Project Overview

The Spam Classifier project builds a model that classifies messages as either **spam** or **ham** (not spam). It uses the Naive Bayes algorithm, which is effective for text classification tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **SMS Spam Collection** dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains labeled SMS messages with either "spam" or "ham" classifications.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`
